# Data_Analysis_Machine_Learning
Analyzed California  Fire Incidents Data from Kaggle with Python; Used machine learning to identify the key predictors with different classifiers such as DecisionTree, RandonForest, Gaussian, Clustering.

This project includes:\
1)Analysis of Wildfire Duration Time on the effects of Resources (AirTankers, PersonnelInvolved, Dozers and so on) to see how effective Resources help control wildfire duration time\
2)Analysis of Wildfire Severity by Region, County, Admin Unit to see what area deserve more resources\
3)Analysis of Wildfires in Santa Clara County

Findings:
Finding 1: For those minor incidents, people would just let it burn without taking any action. So the duration days for them became the longest.

Finding 2: For the major incidents, the increase of resources doesn't necessarily reduce the probability of incidents' duration days below 84 days, except AirTankers. For AirTankers, the increase of use of AirTanker, do reduce the probability of incidents' duration days below 84 days.

Finding 3: In general, from year 2013-2019, Northern California have wildfire incidents with more AcresBurned than Southern California; however the incident duration time in Northern California, on average, is lower than that in Southern California.

Finding 4: The top three AdminUnit have taken care of the most wildfire incidents is Riverside from Southern California, Sonoma Lake Nape from Northern California, and Santa Clara from Northern California.

Finding 5: Santa Clara Admin Unit been taken care of around 5.2% of the total number of incidents, however only about 2.4% incidents actually happened in Santa Clara County. Santa Clara Admin Unit has been helping other counties in controlling wildfires over year 2013-2019, expecially nearby counties such as Sontra Costa, Alameda, Stanislaus and San Joaquin.

Finding 6: The consequences of incidents in Santa Clara county are light in Northern California, with none Fatalities and Injuries and relatively small AcresBurned, StructuresDamaged, StructuresDestroyed over year 2013 to 2019; except for the duration time. Santa Clara incidents usually last longer than those in other places in Northern California.

Finding 7: The probabilities of incidents happened near highway in Santa Clara County compared to Northern California and all area are very low.
